# LetUsOrder
As the project name suggests, LetUsOrder is an eStore where a user can explore multiple categories and can add products to the cart so to buy them. Users even got the functionality to add and sell products from their own shops if any. The project involved working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, as Front End Technologies and JSP, Java Servlets, JDBC with MySQL for Server Side and Database Connectivity. Also, Jakarta's Mail API for sending auto-generated emails (such as OTP for Account Verification &amp; Recovery and Order Confirmation at CheckOut) and Haversine for finding best seller based on shortest distance has been used.
